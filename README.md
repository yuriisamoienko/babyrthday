# babyrthday
Share a beautiful postcard of your child birthday in a few touches

Notes:
- Because of the fixed padding from bottom (88pt + button + ...), the circle placeholder (blue circle with baby smile) moves down and down as a phone screen gets bigger, for example on iPhone 12 Pro Max. Again, this is described in the task, but the result is ugly.
- Project has modular structure. If it isn't compiled from the first try after checkout - hit the build button again, this helps.
